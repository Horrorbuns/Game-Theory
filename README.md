# Game-Theory
Classwork for Game Theory.

///IMPORTANT///
Please don't edit any of this code unless you've contact me beforehand!

I've set up this repository so that y'all can add in your artwork into gamemaker itself, and adjust it to where it works within the game. If you need help doing so, please shoot me an email/message me on steam. Also, please be sure to comment out what you've done before you commit so that we all know what changes have been made!

If you're using the free version of Gamemaker on Steam, you may need to download GM:Studio (which should be free) through Yoyo Games' website!

Free version is on the left, so you don't have to worry about the weird limitations that the steam version has.
